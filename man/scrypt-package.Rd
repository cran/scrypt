    scrypt key derivation functions for R
}
\description{
    scrypt is an R package for working with scrypt. Scrypt is a password-based key
    derivation function created by Colin Percival. The algorithm was specifically
    designed to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by
    requiring large amounts of memory.

The scrypt package can be used for hashing and verifying passwords, or encrypting and 
decrypting data. Additionally, the scrypt function can be used directly.
